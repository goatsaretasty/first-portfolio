          <p>Below is a peek into my web-development journey, which began three months ago with Udacity's Grow with Google front-end (FEND) web developer challenge course
            and has since led to a full FEND nanodegree scholarship.</p>
          <p>What's amazing is that I started in journalism, dabbled in counseling, worked in project management and ELA publishing, and now I'm...</p>
          <p>Yeah, I found (and love) web development.</p>
          <p>Expect more projects in the coming months, including web apps, games and full-blown sites.</p>

          <h2>A little bit about me...</h2>
          <p>I grew up on the West Coast, traveled the country after high school and ultimately wound up in Portland, Oregon. There, I studied journalism and graphic design at a local community college, set behind the beautiful Mt. Hood. I became the news, design and associate editor of the campus newspaper and won first-place awards in the categories of best feature story and best writing at the 2006 Oregon Newspaper Publishers Association's collegiate conference.</p>
          <p>I also worked tirelessly on extracurricular activities, from student government to honors work, and as a founding officer of the college's then-new Writers' Group.</p>
          <p>At Portland State University, I switched gears to studying psychology, sociology, statistics, women's studies and biology. My broad interests earned me three bachelor's degrees, which was admittedly overkill. As with junior college, I was heavily involved in student government and other campus groups, having served as the Judicial Board's chief justice. Additionally, I was a head teacher's aide (as an undergraduate) in the
            behavioral neurosciences department, as well as a research assistant. In 2010, I became a Ronald E. McNair undergraduate achievement scholar and conducted original, grant-funded social science research.</p>
          <p>Later, I would go on to study counseling and education, and I'd ultimately end up as a project manager for international ELA publishers.</p>
          <p>But I've always had a passion for computer science, data and design, and I hope to one day call myself a professional front-end developer!</p>
