# Drunkenkismet's Udacity FEND Project #1 Portfolio</h1>

An HTML, CSS and JavaScript project that showcases technical and design skills through presentation of work I've done both inside and outside the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001?gclid=Cj0KCQjw_ZrXBRDXARIsAA8KauQsypAOTlpha3ku6W6n3XNbn2rDIckjMuE850oIK3NoN5upPpPLMu0aAj6GEALw_wcB">Udacity Front-End (FEND) Web Developer nanodegree program</a>.

## Purpose

Over the course of the FEND program, students complete a variety of labs and projects, from simple experiments in markup, styling, and scripting, to more intermediate exercises. The first project, known simply as "The Portfolio," partially serves to showcase the results of these earlier challenges. 

The focus of the portfolio, though, is the construction of a resource that employs responsiveness. This includes considerations of breakpoints and responsive images through media queries. Additionally, it serves as a "proof-in-the-pudding" as to a student's knowledge of markup, ARIA compliance, styling, adherence to Udacity's style guide, and the introductory scripting techniques taught up to that point in the program.

## Structure and DEployment

This project employs the standard `index.html`, `styles.css` and `scripts.js` files, as well as this accompanying README.md file. 

To get started, fork or clone these files to your desktop and launch the index.html file in your preferred browser. 

Use your browser's developer tools to examine the functionality and interplay between each file.

## Contributing

I'm still relatively new to FEND. If you'd like to suggest changes, please, do so through the regular Github collaboration methods, but make sure to include the reasons for any changes you commit. 

## Licensing

This project adheres strictly to the MIT license. If you use any part of it, simple attribution is all that's required.
