        <p>South America's largest wild canid, the maned fox has a thick red coat, white tail, and distrinctly tall, erect ears. While they average only 50 pounds, maned wolves are usually taller than Great Danes. Not much is known of wild maned wolves, with the bulk of knowledge coming from studies conducted after they've entered human care. In some countries, maned wolves are referred to as the &ldquo;fox on stilts.&rdquo;</p>
